1. INTRODUCTION                                           *vimagit-introduction*

vimagit is a plugin which try to mimic the fantastic magit emacs plugin. If you
already know the original plugin, give it a try. If you never have heard about
magit (or maybe emacs), this is IMO the most efficient way to stage hunks and
craft nice commits.

===============================================================================
2. INSTALLATION                                           *vimagit-installation*

The plugin hierarchy tree respects the vim plugin standard. It is compatible
with pathogen (and most probably vundle).

To install:
>
  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit
<

===============================================================================
3. TL;DR                                                         *vimagit-TL;DR*

This is the minimal required set of command you must know to start playing
with vimagit. See |vimagit-commands| for a complete description.

To simply test vimagit, modify/add/delete/rename some files in a git
repository and open vim.

> :Magit
Open magit buffer with :Magit command.

> <C-n>
Jump to next hunk with <C-n>. The cursor should be on the header of a hunk.

> S
If the hunk is in "Unstage changes" section, press S in Normal mode: the
hunk is now staged, and appears in "Staged changes" section. The opposite is
also possible, i.e. unstage a hunk from "Staged section".

If you move the cursor to the file header and press S, the whole file is
staged.

> CC
Once you have stage all the required changes, type CC. A new section
`Commit message` appears and cursor move to it. Type your commit message, in
Insert mode this time. Once it's done, write your commit message with :w (or
:x, :wq, ZZ).

Voila! you created your first commit with vimagit!

===============================================================================
4. USAGE                                                         *vimagit-usage*

MODES                                                            *vimagit-modes*

vimagit buffer has modes. Mappings may have different behavior, depending on
current mode and cursor position.

For the moment, vimagit counts only two modes.

STAGE MODE                                                  *vimagit-stage-mode*

This is the default mode. In this mode, you can stage and unstage hunks,
refresh vimagit buffer...

COMMIT MODE                                                *vimagit-commit-mode*

In this mode, `Commit message` section is open, you can write your commit
message and validate your commit.
Commit mode has two flavors.

* `normal`: current commit will be a new commit.
* `amend`: current commit will be meld with previous commit.
  * Previous commit message is shown in `Commit message` section.
  * Use this flavor if you forgot something in the previous commit.

By the way, you can also perform all stage mode actions in commit mode.

SECTIONS                                                      *vimagit-sections*

IMPORTANT: mappings can have different meanings regarding the cursor position.

There are 5 sections:
* Info: this section display some information about the git repository, like
  the current branch and the HEAD commit.
* Commit message: this section appears in commit mode (see below). It contains
  the message to be committed.
* Staged changes: this sections contains all staged files/hunks, ready to
  commit.
* Unstaged changes: this section contains all unstaged and untracked
  files/hunks.
* Stash list: this section contains all stahes.

INLINE MODIFICATIONS                               *vimagit-inline-modification*

* It is possible to modify the content to be staged or unstaged in magit
  buffer, with some limitations:
  * only lines starting with a + sign can be modified
  * no line can be deleted

VISUAL SELECTION                                      *vimagit-visual-selection*

It is possible to stage and unstage part of hunk, by different ways:
* By visually selecting some lines, then [un]staging the selection with S.
* By marking some lines "to be staged" with M, then [un]staging these selected
  lines with S.
* [Un]staging individual lines with L.

Visual selection and marked lines have some limitations for the moment:
* Selection/marks must be within a single hunk.
* Marks not within the hunk currently staged are lost during stage process magit
  buffer refresh.

COMMANDS                                                      *vimagit-commands*

                                                            *magit#show_magit()*
Function to open magit buffer. This buffer will handle the git repository
including focused file.
It is possible to handle multiple git repositories within one vim instance.
Each git repository will have its own buffer.

It takes 3 parameters:
  * orientation (mandatory): it can be
      - 'v', curent window is split vertically, and magit is displayed in new
        buffer
      - 'h', curent window is split horizontally, and magit is displayed in
        new buffer
      - 'c', magit is displayed in current buffer
  * show_all_files: define how file diffs are shown by default for this session
    (see |vimagit-g:magit_default_show_all_files|)
  * foldlevel: set default magit buffer foldlevel for this session
    (see |vimagit-g:magit_default_fold_level|)

                                                                        *:Magit*
  :Magit     open magit buffer in a vertical split (see |magit#show_magit()|)

                                                                    *:MagitOnly*
  :MagitOnly open magit buffer in current window (see |magit#show_magit()|)
You can create a bash alias like magit="vim -c MagitOnly"


MAPPINGS                                                      *vimagit-mappings*

For each mapping, user can redefine the behavior with its own mapping. Each
variable is described below as           *vimagit-g:magit_nameofmapping_mapping*

For example, to redefine the <leader>M mapping, user should add this line in
its |vimrc|:
let g:magit_show_magit_mapping='m'

Mapping update                                          *vimagit-mapping-update*
--------------

Since vimagit 1.7, jump mappings have changed:
   Jump next hunk : N -> <C-n>
   Jump prev hunk : P -> <C-p>

Global mappings
---------------
Following mappings are broadly set, and are applied in all vim buffers.

                                      *vimagit-<leader>M*
                                      *vimagit-g:magit_show_magit_mapping*
 <leader>M  Open Magit buffer

Local mappings
--------------

Following mappings are set locally, for magit buffer only, in normal mode.

Some mappings are set for the whole magit buffer, others are set for specific
section only.

  <S>       If cursor is in a hunk, stage/unstage hunk at cursor position.
            If cursor is in diff header, stage/unstage whole file at cursor
            position.
            If some lines in the hunk are selected (see |visual-use|), stage
            only selected lines (only works for staging).
            If some lines in the hunk are marked (see |vimagit-M|), stage only
            these lines (only works for staging).
            When cursor is in "Unstaged changes" section, it will stage the
            hunk/file.
            On the other side, when cursor is in "Staged changes" section, it
            will unstage hunk/file.

  <F>       Stage/unstage the whole file at cursor position.
            When cursor is in "Unstaged changes" section, it will stage the
            file.
            On the other side, when cursor is in "Staged changes" section, it
            will unstage file.

  <M>       Mark the current line to be staged.
            If some lines in the hunk are selected (see |visual-use|), mark
            selected lines.
            To staged marked lines, press S (see |vimagit-S|) in the current
            hunk.

  <E>       If cursor is in a hunk, cursor will move in the file containing
            this hunk, at the line of the beginning of the hunk.
             - if the file is already visible in a |window|, cursor moves to
               this window at the hunk line
             - if there is more than one window open, cursor moves to last
               accessed window and open buffer at the hunk line
             - if there is only magit window opened, split vertically, moves
               cursor to new split and open buffer at the hunk line
            E means 'edit'.
            NOTE: this function is extremely powerful, just give it a try!

  <CA>      From `stage mode` or `commit mode`: set commit mode in amend
            flavor, and display "Commit message" section with previous commit
            message.
            Commit will be meld with previous commit.

  <CU>      From `commit mode`: go back to stage mode (current commit message
            will be lost).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


AUTOCMD                                                        *vimagit-autocmd*

Magit will raise some events at some point. User can plug some specific
commands to these events (see |vimagit-autocmd_example|).

VimagitBufferInit                                    *vimagit-VimagitBufferInit*

This event is raised when the magit buffer is initialized (i.e. each time
|magit#show_magit()| is called.

VimagitRefresh                                          *vimagit-VimagitRefresh*

This event is raised every time the magit buffer is refreshed, event if no
file is updated.

VimagitUpdateFile                                    *vimagit-VimagitUpdateFile*

This event is raised each time a file status is updated in magit buffer
(typically when a file or a hunk is staged or unstaged). The variable
|g:magit_last_updated_buffer| is set to the last updated file, with its
absolute path.

Note: |g:magit_last_updated_buffer| will be updated and VimagitUpdateFile event
will be raised only if the buffer is currently opened in vim.

VimagitEnterCommit                                  *vimagit-VimagitEnterCommit*

This event is raised when the commit section opens and the cursor is
placed in this section. For example, the user may want to go straight into
insert mode when committing, defining this |autocmd| in vimrc:
>
  autocmd User VimagitEnterCommit startinsert
<

VimagitLeaveCommit                                  *vimagit-VimagitLeaveCommit*

This event is raised when the commit section is closed, because the user
finished to write its commit message or canceled it. For example, the user
wants to set the |textwidth| of the vimagit buffer while editing a commit
message, defining these |autocmd| in vimrc:
>
  autocmd User VimagitEnterCommit setlocal textwidth=72
  autocmd User VimagitLeaveCommit setlocal textwidth=0
<

Autocmd example                                        *vimagit-autocmd_example*
---------------

The following example calls the vim-gitgutter refresh function on a specific
buffer each time vimagit update the git status of this file.
>
  autocmd User VimagitUpdateFile
    \ if ( exists("*gitgutter#process_buffer") ) |
    \ 	call gitgutter#process_buffer(bufnr(g:magit_last_updated_buffer), 0) |
    \ endif
