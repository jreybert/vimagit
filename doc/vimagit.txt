1. INTRODUCTION                                           *vimagit-introduction*

vimagit is a plugin which try to mimic the fantastic magit emacs plugin. If you
already know the original plugin, give it a try. If you never have heard about
magit (or maybe emacs), this is IMO the most efficient way to stage hunks and
craft nice commits.

===============================================================================
2. INSTALLATION                                           *vimagit-installation*

The plugin hierarchy tree respects the vim plugin standard. It is compatible
with pathogen (and most probably vundle).

To install:
>
  cd ~/.vim/bundle
  git clone https://github.com/jreybert/vimagit
<

===============================================================================
3. TL;DR                                                         *vimagit-TL;DR*

This is the minimal required set of command you must know to start playing
with vimagit. See |vimagit-commands| for a complete description.

To simply test vimagit, modify/add/delete/rename some files in a git
repository and open vim.

> :Magit
Open magit buffer with :Magit command.

> N
Jump to next hunk with N. The cursor should be on the header of a hunk.

> S
If the hunk is in "Unstage changes" section, press S in Normal mode: the
hunk is now staged, and appears in "Staged changes" section. The opposite is
also possible, i.e. unstage a hunk from "Staged section".

If you move the cursor to the file header and press S, the whole file is
staged.

> CC
Once you have stage all the required changes, press CC. A new section "Commit
message" appears and cursor move to it. Type your commit message, in Insert
mode this time. Once it's done, go back in Normal mode, and press CC: you
created your first commit with vimagit!

===============================================================================
4. USAGE                                                         *vimagit-usage*

SECTIONS                                                      *vimagit-sections*

IMPORTANT: mappings can have different meanings regarding the cursor position.

There are 5 sections:
* Info: this section display some information about the git repository, like
  the current branch and the HEAD commit.
* Commit message: this section appears in commit mode (see below). It contains
  the message to be commited.
* Staged changes: this sections contains all staged files/hunks, ready to
  commit.
* Unstaged changes: this section contains all unstaged and untracked
  files/hunks.
* Stash list: this section contains all stahes.

INLINE MODIFICATIONS                               *vimagit-inline-modification*

* It is possible to modify the content to be staged or unstaged in magit
  buffer, with some limitations:
  * only lines starting with a + sign can be modified
  * no line can be deleted

VISUAL SELECTION                                      *vimagit-visual-selection*

It is possible to stage part of hunk, by different ways:
* By visually selecting some lines, then staging the selection with S.
* By marking some lines "to be staged" with M, then staging these selected
  lines with S.
* Staging individual lines with L.

Visual selection and marked lines have some limitations for the moment:
* It only work for "staging", not for "unstaging".
* Selection/marks must be within a single hunk.
* Marks not within the hunk currently staged are lost during stage process magit
  buffer refresh.

COMMANDS                                                      *vimagit-commands*

                                                            *magit#show_magit()*
Function to open magit buffer. This buffer will handle the git repository
including focused file.
It is possible to handle multiple git repositories within one vim instance.
Each git repository will have its own buffer.

It takes 3 parameters:
  * orientation (mandatory): it can be
      - 'v', curent window is split vertically, and magit is displayed in new
        buffer
      - 'h', curent window is split horizontally, and magit is displayed in
        new buffer
      - 'c', magit is displayed in current buffer
  * show_all_files: define how file diffs are shown by default for this session
    (see |vimagit-g:magit_default_show_all_files|)
  * foldlevel: set default magit buffer foldlevel for this session
    (see |vimagit-g:magit_default_fold_level|)

                                                                        *:Magit*
  :Magit     open magit buffer in a vertical split (see |magit#show_magit()|)

                                                                    *:MagitOnly*
  :MagitOnly open magit buffer in current window (see |magit#show_magit()|)
You can create a bash alias like magit="vim -c MagitOnly"


MAPPINGS                                                      *vimagit-mappings*

For each mapping, user can redefine the behavior with its own mapping. Each
variable is described below as           *vimagit-g:magit_nameofmapping_mapping*

For example, to redefine the <leader>M mapping, user should add this line in
its |vimrc|:
let g:magit_show_magit_mapping='itsnewmapping'

Global mappings
---------------
Following mappings are broadly set, and are applied in all vim buffers.

                                      *vimagit-<leader>M*
                                      *vimagit-g:magit_show_magit_mapping*
 <leader>M  Open Magit buffer

Local mappings
--------------
Following mappings are set locally, for magit buffer only, in normal mode.

                                      *vimagit-<CR>*  *magit#open_close_folding()*

  <CR>      All file diffs are hidden by default. To see the changes in a
            file, move cursor to the filename line, and press Enter. You can
            close the changes display retyping Enter.

  S         If cursor is in a hunk, stage/unstage hunk at cursor position.
            If cursor is in diff header, stage/unstage whole file at cursor
            position.
            If some lines in the hunk are selected (see |visual-use|), stage
            only selected lines (only works for staging).
            If some lines in the hunk are marked (see |vimagit-M|), stage only
            these lines (only works for staging).
            When cursor is in "Unstaged changes" section, it will stage the
            hunk/file.
            On the other side, when cursor is in "Staged changes" section, it
            will unstage hunk/file.

  F         Stage/unstage the whole file at cursor position.
            When cursor is in "Unstaged changes" section, it will stage the
            file.
            On the other side, when cursor is in "Staged changes" section, it

  M
            Mark the current line to be staged.
            If some lines in the hunk are selected (see |visual-use|), mark
            selected lines.
            To staged marked lines, press S (see |vimagit-S|) in the current
            hunk.

                                    *vimagit-DDD*            *magit#stage_hunk(1)*

When this variable is set to 0, all diff files are hidden by default.
When this variable is set to 1, all diff for modified files are shown by default.
When this variable is set to 2, all diff for all files are shown by default.
Default value is 1.
NB: for repository with large number of differences, display may be slow.

Default foldlevel for magit buffer.
When set to 0, both filenames and hunks are folded.
When set to 1, filenames are unfolded and hunks are folded.
When set to 2, filenames and hunks are unfolded.
Default value is 1.
let g:magit_default_fold_level=[012]

                                              *vimagit-g:magit_default_sections*

without warning the user. If the number of diff lines to display is greater than
this variable, vimagit will ask a confirmation to the user before refreshing the
buffer. If user answer is 'yes', vimagit will display diff lines as expected.
If user answer is 'no', vimagit will close all file diffs before refreshing.
Defaulty value is 10000.
let g:magit_warning_max_lines=val
